# Proyecto TLP – Syntax Parser with Error Handling

This is an academic project focused on building an LL(1) syntax parser with integrated error detection and handling.
Developed using Python (with PLY for lexical and syntactic analysis) and sample code in C, the parser takes source code as input, tokenizes it, analyzes its syntax against a predefined grammar, and produces structured parsing results.

## Key Features
- Lexer and Parser Implementation – Built with PLY to handle tokenization and parsing.
- Error Handling – Detects syntax errors and provides basic recovery mechanisms.
- Grammar Support – Includes LL(1) grammar definitions in .txt and .bnf formats.
- Sample Programs – Example C source files for testing the parser’s capabilities.
- Modular Design – Separate modules for lexical analysis, parsing logic, and binary search tree traversal.

## Repository Contents

- ourLexer.py – Defines lexical tokens and rules.
- parserYmanejoerrores.py – Contains parsing logic and error management.
- gramatica_LL1.txt / gramatica_LL1_BNF.bnf – Grammar files in plain text and BNF format.
- fuente.c / prueba.c – Example input programs for testing.
- tabla.txt – Parsing table for LL(1) analysis.
- bstInorder.py – Utility for binary search tree traversal (used in parsing visualization).
